## Project objectives: 
#### 1) To predict 30-years average moisture deficits (MD30) using Ordinary Kriging at unsampled locations. 
#### 2) To identify if the fluctuation of Groundwater in terms of Mean Height Water Level (MHW) variable has an influence on MD30 using Regression Kriging. 
#### 3) To determine the correlation between MD30 and MHW variable using CO-Kriging
